A few questions which you might consider later (with the caveat that I am not all familiar with the practices in this field or problem):
1. How many samples did you use to fit the NN? Is it sufficient?
2. Did you use dimension reductions (it sounds like you used PCA)? If so, how many dimensions did you reduce it to and how did you decide on this number?
3. Why not do smoothing and constrained optimizations in "one go" (maybe you did)? I gather that the the two might be able to be combined easily?
4. How often is the constraints binding in the constrained optimizations?
